  <h2>Friends</h2>
  <p>Friends are established when there is a 2-way "favorites" or when you are following each other. You can friend any of your followers, but can only follow those who do not already follow you. If they follow you back, then you become friends.</p>
  <p>As a user, I can view and contact my friends.</p>
  <p>As a user, I "unfriend" someone by blocking them or removing them from my favorites.</p>
